# Sick of Subscriptions? So Am I! ðŸš€

Sick and tired of paying for subscription services, I decided to make my own free alternatives to some apps. Might as well share them with you!

I just make apps I might want to use and publish them **for free**â€”code and all. They might be a little janky, but they do the trick. 

## What You'll Find Here ðŸ’»
- **ðŸš´ Fitness & Mapping Tools** - Track routes, progress, and more.
- **ðŸ›  Open-Source Utilities** - Useful apps that donâ€™t lock features behind a paywall.
- **ðŸŽ® Game Mods & Enhancements** - Tweaks for transport and realism.

Everything here is freeâ€”no hidden fees, no premium plans, no nonsense. Just take it, use it, and improve it if you want. 

> "I rawdog the software industryâ€”no middlemen, no paywalls, just straight-up free code. Might be a bit rough, but hey, it works!" ðŸ˜†
