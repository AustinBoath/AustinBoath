# Hi, I'm Austin Boath! 🚀

## About Me

I'm an aviation enthusiast, cyclist, wantrepreneur, and a builder—whether it's businesses, maps, or cool open-source projects! My work and hobbies revolve around **transport, fitness, and technology**. If it moves fast or can be optimized, I'm into it.

## What I Do ✈️🚲💻

- **✈️ Aviation** - Training as a pilot and obsessed with everything that flies.
- **🚲 Cycling** - Pushing the limits on two wheels—whether it's for fitness or just pure fun.
- **💻 Open-Source Projects** - Building tools to help people track, explore, and optimize their journeys.
- **🗺️ Mapping** - Designing realistic cities and transport infrastructure in OpenGeofiction.
- **📈 Entrepreneurship** - Always looking for the next opportunity to build something useful.

## Cool Projects 🛠️

- 🏙️ **OpenGeofiction Mapping** - Creating detailed, realistic transport networks in a fictional world.
- 🎮 **Custom Transport Mods** - Enhancing Minecraft & other games with better transportation systems.

## My Philosophy 🏗️

I believe in **building for impact**—whether it's improving transportation, creating tools that people actually use, or finding new ways to make fitness more engaging. I love projects that mix **real-world utility with fun**.
🌴 If I could live anywhere, it would be **somewhere warm with endless cycling routes and an airport nearby**.
